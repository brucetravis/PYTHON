1. import numpy as np
import numpy as np: This line imports the NumPy library, which is widely used for working with arrays (lists of numbers) and performing mathematical operations on them. The as np part means that you can now refer to NumPy using the shortcut np instead of writing numpy each time. This saves you time and makes your code cleaner.

2. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: This line imports the matplotlib library, which is used for plotting graphs and charts. Specifically, you're importing the pyplot module and giving it the alias plt. This makes it easier to refer to functions like plt.plot() for creating graphs and plt.show() to display them.

3. times = np.arange(0, 100, 1)
np.arange(0, 100, 1): This uses the arange function from NumPy, which generates an array (or list) of numbers starting from 0 up to 100, but not including 100. The 1 at the end tells it to take steps of size 1, meaning the numbers will go 0, 1, 2, 3,... up to 99. This array will represent the time (x-axis) in your plot.

4. values = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(100))
np.random.randn(100): This generates 100 random numbers drawn from a standard normal distribution (a bell curve). These numbers could be positive or negative.

np.cumsum(): This function computes the cumulative sum of the numbers in the array. So instead of just having random values, you'll get a running total of the random numbers. For example, if the first two random values are 2 and 3, the cumulative sum would be 2 and then 5 after adding 3.

values will store these cumulative sums, which represent some fluctuating data (for example, stock prices or temperature over time).

5. plt.plot(times, values)
plt.plot(times, values): This tells matplotlib to create a line plot using the times array (x-axis) and the values array (y-axis). It will draw a line connecting all the points (time, value) on the graph.

6. plt.show()
plt.show(): This command makes sure that the plot is displayed on the screen. Without this, the plot won't appear if you're running the code in a script.
