FIZZBUZZ
Print numbers from 1 to 100
for multiples of 3, print “Fizz”
for 5 print “Buzz”, 
and for both, print “FizzBuzz”.


# NOTES
Does the Order (5 then 3) Make a Difference?
Logically, no → It still produces the correct output.
Performance-wise, no big difference → Both are efficient.
Preference-wise, YES → If it feels more natural to think multiples of 5 first, then go for it!
Key Takeaway
The most important rule is that FizzBuzz comes first to avoid double-printing.
After that, whether you check 5 before 3 or 3 before 5 is just a preference.

Great thinking! Do you want to try tweaking another logic-based problem next? 😊
