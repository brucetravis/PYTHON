# # 3. Scenario Task: Inventory Management for a Retail Store

# Imagine you are tasked with developing an inventory management system for a retail store. 
# The system should keep track of the products available in the store, their quantities, and prices. 
# You need to design a Python program using classes and objects to manage this inventory.

# Question:

# You are the software developer responsible for building an inventory management system for a 
# retail store. Your task is to design a Python program that will help the store keep track of its 
# products, quantities, and prices, allowing employees to add, update, sell, and restock items 
# efficiently.

# Here are the specific requirements for your program:

# Create a class Product with the following attributes:

# product_id (an identifier for the product).
# name (the name of the product).
# price (the price of the product).
# quantity (the quantity of the product in stock).

# Create a class Inventory to manage the store's inventory. 
# This class should have the following methods:

# add_product(product): a method that takes a Product object and adds it to the inventory.
# update_product(product_id, new_price, new_quantity): a method that updates the price and 
# quantity of a product by its product_id.

# sell_product(product_id, quantity_sold): a method that sells a specified quantity of a product, 
# reducing the product's quantity in stock.

# restock_product(product_id, quantity_restocked): a method that restocks a product with a specified 
# quantity, increasing its quantity in stock.

# calculate_revenue(): a method that calculates and returns the total revenue generated 
# from the products sold.

# display_inventory(): a method that displays the current state of the inventory, 
# showing product details (name, price, quantity).

# Now, create an instance of the Inventory class and demonstrate how it can be used to manage the 
# store's inventory efficiently. You should be able to add products, update their information, 
# sell products, restock items, and calculate the total revenue.

# Ensure your solution showcases proper class design, object instantiation, and method usage, 
# while also addressing the real-life scenario of retail inventory management
